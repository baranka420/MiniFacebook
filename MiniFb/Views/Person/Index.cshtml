            * Any C# can be written inside the view, however it is an extremely bad practise. Limit the c# code in the view to loops and a *SMALL* number of conditional statements.
            * When writing c# code inside the view it must be preceeded with a @ sign. For  single line expression @ followed by you statement is enough. Sometimes, wrapping your statement in brackets is necessary.
            * For block of code use @{ [Your C# code] } pattern. It is used in this view on lines 6 to 8
